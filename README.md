##Gameplay

1. Devotees behavior are controlled by Words and Powers
2. The longer you exist, the more difficult it is to control your devotees. For each Power, except `listen` and `divineIntervention`, the cost increases at rate proportional to the number of times it has been called.
3. Words are passages of text constructed by the player. The cost to construct new Passages increases at rate proportional to the number of times it has been called. The AI controlling the devotees, events, and the antithesis looks at the passaages for direction.
4. Contradictory Words can cause division among devotees. 
5. Words have multiple interpretations that can change their effects on AI. They manifest as they they get older.
6. The Antithesis can burn your followers, destory your buildings, and corrupt your word. It can also be used as a way to increase faith or punish certain citizens.
7. Yor devotees can spread your word through conquest, trade, missionaries. The rate of these trips is based on the Word. Your devotees can also be invaded, preached towards, or prompted for trade.
8. Your word can spread to new lands. This is when reintrpretations can occur.
